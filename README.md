# Placement-Prediction
Student Placement Predictor is a system which predicts student placement status using machine learning techniques. This system is beneficial for institutions to predict studentâ€™s campus placement and placement officers can work on identifying the weakness of each student. They can also suggest improvements so that the student can overcome the weakness and supply to the best of their abilities. Algorithms like Logistic Regression and SVC will give maximum accuracy to the prediction.

The future enhancements of the project is to focus on to add some more parameters to predict more efficient placement status. We can also enhance the project by predicting some solutions or suggestions for the output generated by system.
